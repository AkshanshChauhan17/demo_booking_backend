🧠 How Real-Time Works

User books a seat

Backend updates MongoDB

Backend emits seatsUpdated event

All connected clients receive updated seat data

UI updates instantly

🔒 Best Practices Used

MongoDB _id kept internal

Public-safe UUIDs

Socket events emitted only after DB update

Booked seats disabled on UI

Clean separation of backend & frontend

🛠️ Future Enhancements

⏳ Seat hold timer (auto release)

🔐 JWT authentication (admin/user)

💳 Payment integration

🎥 Cinema-style seat layout (A1, A2…)

🧠 Redis for socket scaling

📱 Progressive Web App (PWA)
